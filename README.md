In this Project,

PySpark was used to predict what type of crime will occur in a given region with prepared code for Kaggle submission

https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/overview

Applied cycle composed of the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Data Exploration for understanding the variables and create intuition on the data.</li>
<li>Feature Engineering to create additional variables from the existing.</li>
<li>Data Transformation for preparing the dataset for the learning algorithms.</li>
<li>Training / Testing data creation to evaluate the performance of your models and fine-tune their hyperparameters.</li>
<li>Model selection and evaluation. This will be the final goal; creating a model that predicts the probability of each type of crime based on the location and the date.</li>
</ol>
